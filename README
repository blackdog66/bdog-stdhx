bdog-stdhx provides haXe integration features and standard library support. I
was just bundling the js dir, but this can't live on it's own so the entire std
dir is here.

I use git-svn rebase to sync this project with current haxe before uploading to
github - so i should be fully compatible with latest haxe.

NOTE
----

bdog-node contains 3 files from this project

js/Node.hx
js/Lib.hx
js/Boot.hx

they should be exactly the same as what's in here. The reason for this subset is to
make it easier for people coming from javascript just to use bdog-node on it's own
without the entire standard library which may seem like overload.

This project then is to integrate Node.js deeply into the haXe infrastructure and hence
touches many parts of the standard library.

You should bdog-node to just get at the Node.js API.

If you want full integration then use this lib.

Status
------

In heavy dev use with care.

Most of the file io stuff is done. Check js.File, js.FileSystem, js.io/* etc.
